HOOTER SOUND FILE INSTRUCTIONS
================================

This directory needs a hooter sound file named: hooter.mp3

To add the sound file:

1. Download or create a hooter/notification sound (MP3 format)
   - You can find free sounds at:
     * Freesound.org
     * ZapSplat.com
     * Pixabay (Audio section)

2. Name the file: hooter.mp3

3. Place it in this directory:
   HomeServicesProvider/android/app/src/main/res/raw/hooter.mp3

4. The sound file should be:
   - Format: MP3
   - Duration: 1-3 seconds (recommended)
   - Volume: Normalized for consistent playback
   - Sample rate: 44.1kHz or 48kHz

Alternative approach:
- You can use any existing notification sound by renaming it to hooter.mp3
- For testing, you can use a simple beep or bell sound

For iOS:
- Add the same hooter.mp3 file to the Xcode project
- Right-click on project → Add Files → Select hooter.mp3
- Make sure "Copy items if needed" is checked
- Add to both targets if necessary
